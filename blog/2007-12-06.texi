@unnumberedsec A flavour of AVHRR

In the past few days I have been trying to find suitable software and process for AVHRR data processing. The METOP AVHRR format looks like an enigma. It should be compatible to AVHRR, but despite that I tried hard to find a tool to unpack the file, and even tried to write a Fortran program myself, I couldnâ€™t find anything that decodes the file downloaded from CLASS.

What made the search not totally fruitless is a image processing tool, BEAM, which works nicely with AVHRR and a number of other data files. I can use it to open AVHRR 16-bit and 8-bit Level 1b file (10-bit not tested yet), do some simple preprocessing and statistics, then export the file as GeoTIFF or other formats, which can be read by GRASS GIS + GDAL. It is worth noting that BEAM is free as in free speech software published under GPL v3 and can run on any platform with Java Runtime Environment.

With the help of BEAM and GRASS I managed to produce my first AVHRR-derived NDVI image this afternoon. Seems I am finally on track. In the coming days there are a number of things that I can look at:

@itemize
@item AVHRR Pathfinder data, their advantages and limits, suggested by one of my supervisor;
@item Snow and ice cover mapping with AVHRR;
@item Time series data and change detection;
@item MODIS data and its interoperability with AVHRR.
